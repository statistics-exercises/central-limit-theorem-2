# Generating normal random variables

As discussed in the video if our random variable is generated by some unknown (random) process we very often model the distribution of possible values for it using the normal distribution.  The reason for doing so is that the central limit theorem tells us that if a large number of random variables are added together the mean is (approximately) a sample from a normal distribution.  This distribution has some nice properties as we shall see in subsequent exercises.  Furthermore, when we use statistics to model a phenomenon it is usually because what we are observing is controlled by many random factors.  Thus using the distribution for a sum of random variables seems appropriate. 

Without further ado lets thus get on to generating normal random variables.  In the later years of your degree, you may learn how one can generate standard normal random variables from uniform random variables using a Box-Muller transform.  For now, though it is sufficient to know that in Python you can generate a standard Normal random variable using the following command:

````
mynormal = np.random.normal(0,1)
````

In other words, this function will generate a random variable from a normal distribution that has expectation 0 and variance 1.  What, you might ask, do we do if we would like a normal random variable from a distribution with expectation a and variance b?  The answer is quite straightforward we perform a standardising transformation and thus convert a normal random variable, Z, with expectation 0 and variable 1 into a normal random variable, X, with expectation a and variance b using:

Your task here is  to write a function called `normal` that takes two parameters `mu` and `sigma2` as input.  This function should return a normal random variable from a normal distribution with expectation `mu` and with variance `sigma2`.  The remaining code in the cell on the left will ensure that a graph is drawn showing the various values a sample of 100 of these variables take.
